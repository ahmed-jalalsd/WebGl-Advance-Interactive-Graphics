# WebGl Basic game
The Goal is to use WebGL to draw a small interactive game where a Horse 
will run and jump an obstacle when the user clicks a button.

To achieve the required effects a series of improvements are to be implemented in the base code
A - Hierarchical model for the horse.
B - Hierarchical model for the obstacle.
C - procedural texture (checkboard) on the horseâ€™s body.
D - Animations consist of Run function to make the horse run and another function called jump to make the horse jump over the obstacle.
E- Button that starts the animations.
